#' Forward Stepwise and Cut method for inference in MTD models
#'
#' A function for inference in MTD Markov chains using the FSC method. This function
#' estimates the relevant lag set \eqn{\Lambda} through the FSC algorithm.
#'
#' @param X A vector or single-column data frame containing a chain sample
#' (`X[1]` is the most recent). Missing values (`NA`) are not allowed.
#' @param d A positive integer representing an upper bound for the chain order.
#' @param l An integer between 2 and \code{d} specifying the number of candidate lags
#' selected by the FS step before applying CUT.
#' @param A A vector with distinct nonnegative integers representing the state space.
#' If not informed, this function will set \code{A <- sort(unique(X))}.
#' @param alpha A positive real number used in the CUT threshold (which determines if two
#' distributions can be considered different). The larger the \code{alpha}, the greater
#' the distance required to consider that there is a difference between a set of distributions.
#' Defaulted to 0.05.
#' @param mu A positive real number such that \eqn{\code{mu}>(e^{\code{mu}}-1)/2}. \code{mu}
#' is also a component of the same threshold as \code{alpha}.
#' @param xi A positive real number, \code{xi} is also a component of the same threshold as
#'  \code{alpha}.
#' @param cut_fraction A numeric value strictly between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
#' of the sample assigned to the CUT step. Since \code{X[1]} is the most recent observation,
#' CUT uses \code{X[1:ceiling(cut_fraction * length(X))]} observations, whereas FS uses the remaining,
#' chronologically older observations. Both subsamples must contain more than \code{d + 1}
#' observations. The default is \code{0.5}.
#' @param ... Additional arguments (not used in this function, but maintained for compatibility with [hdMTD()]).
#'
#' @details The "Forward Stepwise and Cut" (FSC) algorithm combines the
#' Forward Stepwise (FS) and CUT methods. The FS step uses the chronologically
#' older part of the sample to select candidate lags, which are then refined by
#' applying CUT to the most recent part. The proportion of the sample assigned to CUT is
#' controlled by \code{cut_fraction}. The method was developed by [Ost and Takahashi](http://jmlr.org/papers/v24/22-0266.html)
#' and is especially useful for inference in high-order MTD Markov chains.
